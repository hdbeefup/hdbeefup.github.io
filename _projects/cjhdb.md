CarJacker Hotwired and Gone: HDBEEFUPed (Crazy Drive Away Modernized)  
There are few cool missions, and it might be fun to mess around in this game. And yes there are glitchy spots on the map (can fall through, npc traffic chaos...)  

The unpredictable and dangerous jungle of the big city. Mafia bosses terrify ordinary citizens. Corruption among high ranking officials and rank-and-file cops has reached unbelievable proportions. Few days pass without violent confrontations and bloodshed between rival gangs. News reports are filled with reports of fatal pedestrian collisions. Life has lost all value. Law and order are a thing of the past...  

...Once you thought you'd abandoned the dangerous trade of car theft forever. But life has dealt you a different turn...  

To save the life of your little brother, who has fallen into the hands of the mafia, you have to find and steal 10 cars in just 3 days. To do this you will have to remember not only about breaking car locks and disabling the alarm system, but also about high-speed driving on busy highways, evading the cops at full speed, shooting everything alive around and bribing the cops.  

Now is not the time to choose your means. Be careful, but remember - TIME IS RUNNING OUT!
